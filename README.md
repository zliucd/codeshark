# CodeShark

**CodeShark** is a collection of code snippets written in C (and limited C++) on data structures, algorithms, information contests and other interesting stuff.

The goal of CodeShark is to show the powerfulness, simplicity and elegance of C code with following concepts:
 - Good coding standards
 - Efficient and clean memory useage
 - Reasonable project structure
 - Cross platform to be compiled and executed in different systems and architectures
 - minimal use of C++, only use ```class```, ```new/delete``` and basic containers
